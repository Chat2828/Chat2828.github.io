        I’m V Gould; an amateur game designer, character designer, and illustrator. As of 2025, I have received a non-insignificant amount of 
        technical and hands on training in my preferred fields (see: Education and Experience), as well as spending much of my free time practicing with personal projects. 
        I aim to make these passions into reality, and spend both my free and paid time on creative endeavors. My resume is available upon request.
