            <p class="midLong">When making a piece, I usually begin with a rough sketch on paper, where I will quickly pencil out the general idea of the design without paying mind to
                colors, reference images, or shading. After I'm happy with that, I take a picture of it with my phone (like in this example) or scan it with a printer. I then will
                port the photo/scan to my art app of choice (Currently this is Autodesk Sketchbook) and trace the sketch, while spending more time refining the lines and details, as
                well as using reference images and keeping the final product in mind. After that, I fill in colors and render minimally- though, for full paintings, I will go a little
                more in-depth with shading and background. Sometimes (though not shown here) I will also color my lines and/or add special effects.
