            <h2 class="mp">-Game Design-</h2>
       As of now, I have taken a one year course in computer science that covered web development and various coding languages, a two week course at Yale University with the SIG
       program in engineering and robotics, and am presently enrolled in a two year course in game design and multimedia. <br> <br>
       <h2 class="mp">-Art-</h2>
       The aforementioned gaming and multimedia course also covers visual aspects of game development. Prior to this course, I have also taken yearly art courses at my primary school,
       and have completed a monthlong traditional art course at my local sculpture garden. In my personal time, I do a significant amount of character design and concept art as simple
       practice and creative exercise.
