            <h2 class="mp">-Natalie Vs. The Mind-</h2>
            Natalie Vs. The Mind is a Ren'Py visual novel focused on mental health and the horror of intrusive thoughts. It follows a teenage girl as she struggles with both external 
            and internal conflicts, such as a vicious bully and the demonic manifestation of her issues. <a href="nvm.html">See More</a>

            <h2 class="mp">-Bellaby's Dungeon Escape-</h2>
            Bellaby's Dungeon Escape is an unfinished project made with fellow students during my technical education. I was the background and character artist for the project and
            challenged myself by making the assets in Google Drawings, which created an interesting visual identity for the project. <a href="bde.html">See More</a>

            <h2 class="mp">-"Hel's Game"-</h2>
            While currently operating only under a descriptive, Hel's game will be a fantasy RPG that has a similar gameplay loop to the Fire Emblem series, featuring Helene as the 
            player's avatar and the story's protagonist. Inspiration has also been taken from other popular RPGs like the BotW duology and the Monster Hunter series.

        <h2 class="mp">-Lovin' Hell-</h2>
        Lovin' Hell is the prototype name for a two person game jam. The demo was developed in a week, and more may be made for the project in the future.

       <h2 class="mp">-Hex ROYGBIV-</h2>
            Hex and the Royal Gardens of Bivoth was a very shoddy first ever attempt at a video game. Eventually, I plan for the project to be a seven-part series of short and whimsical
            platformers, following the adventures of the silent protagonist Hex as they (guided by the player) try to reuinite the seven nations of Bivoth- returning color and peace
            to them in the process.
