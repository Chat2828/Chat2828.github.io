    <div class="main">
        <br>
        <h2 class="mp">Character & Background Art</h2>
        <br>
        I made all of the art assets for this indie project. The style our head developer liked was something more scribbly and unpolished, to reflect the story of the game. All of the 
        sprites have alternative facial expressions and blinking animations. 
        <h2 class="mp"></h2>
        <div class="art">
            <h2 class="top">-Home Screen-</h2>
            <img class="mid" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/NvM/home bg NvM.png" alt="Home Screen Background" width="80%" height="100%">
            <p class="top"> The game's opening screen is meant to act as both a hook and a concise representation of the story's premise; it shows the protagonist, Natalie, and the 
                antagonist, Collapsa, who is tormenting her from her mind. The game developer wanted this back-to-back posing in order to represent duality. 
            </p>

        <div class="art">
            <img class="left" src="portfolio images\art for portfolio\NvM\nat sprites NvM\natHappy.png" alt="Natalie's Default Sprite" width="33%" height="100%">
            <h2 class="mid">-Natalie-</h2>
            <p class="mid"> Natalie, the titular character, is designed to represent the playerbase that the game caters towards; teenage girls with more alt tastes. I included the infinity 
                symbol as a nod to the cyclical nature of depression, and the split colors to represent duality. The pink palette is meant to invoke the color of a human brain.
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <div class="art">
            <h2 class="mid">-Bianca-</h2>
            <p class="mid"> Bianca, one of the antagonists, was designed to be imposing and very blatantly representing the stereotypical "rich mean girl," particularly in her crisp suit-like
             outfit. The harsh additions of red are meant to create a sense of danger, particularly with her red gloves that could resemble bloody hands.
            </p>
            <img class="right" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/NvM/bia sprites NvM/biaEvil.png" alt="Bianca's Default Sprite" width="30%" height="100%">
        </div>

        <br>
        <div class="art">
            <img class="left" src="portfolio images\art for portfolio\NvM\iris sprites NvM\irisHappy.png" alt="Iris's Default Sprite" width="30%" height="100%">
            <h2 class="mid">-Iris-</h2>
            <p class="mid"> Iris serves in the story as Natalie's sense of normalcy and security, representing what she has to lose if she gives into Collapsa's urging. As such, her design
                is simple and straightforward; a girl you could easily meet in real life. The anchor on her shirt is a very on-the-nose nod to her being Nat's "anchor".
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <div class="art">
            <h2 class="mid">-Collapsa-</h2>
            <p class="mid"> Collapsa's design is the most visceral of the main cast; she is the silhouette of a demon's decapitated head residing in a broken mirror. She is both a shadow
                and a reflection. Additionally, her severed neck adds a necessary touch of gore to the horror concept of the game.
            </p>
            <img class="right" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/NvM/colla sprites NvM/collaEvil.png" alt="Collapsa's Default Sprite" width="37%" height="100%">
        </div>

        <br>
        <div class="art">
            <h2 class="top">-Cafeteria-</h2>
            <img class="mid" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/NvM/cafeNvM.png" alt="Cafeteria Background" width="80%" height="100%">
            <p class="top"> The school cafeteria sets the stage for the game, being its first background. As such, it is the most dreary and simple of all of the environment designs, while
                also introducing elements that will be common throughout the background arts of the game; the two-toned brick, checkered flooring, and crumpled posters. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <br>
        <div class="art">
            <h2 class="top">-Bathroom-</h2>
            <img class="mid" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/NvM/bathroom NvM.png" alt="Bathroom Background" width="80%" height="100%">
            <p class="top"> The bathroom is where the player is introduced to Collapsa, and where Natalie frequently has intense character moments. Here, I add the first blue shades seen in
                the game, adding more visual complexity. In the center of the frame, often visible in this game style, the suicide hotline number on a poster can be clearly seen in the 
                trash.
