        <br>
        <div class="art">
            <img class="left" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/IMG_3474.jpeg" alt="North Fullbody" width="33%" height="100%">
            <h2 class="mid">-North-</h2>
            <img class="right" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/IMG_3503.jpeg" alt="North Headshot" width="33%" height="100%">
            <p class="mid"> North is a character design that I used as a sort of mannequin while learning various art techniques. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="art">
            <img class="left" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/IMG_3667.jpeg" alt="Inky Fullbody" width="33%" height="100%">
            <h2 class="mid">-Inky-</h2>
            <img class="right" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/IMG_3672.png" alt="Inky Headshot" width="30%" height="100%">
            <p class="mid"> Inky is a monster character- a strange black sludge wearing a human skinsuit as an attempt to blend into society.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="art">
            <img class="left" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/bubblesSprite.png" alt="Chibi Sprite of Bubbles" width="30%" height="100%">
            <h2 class="mid">-Character Sprite Example -</h2>
            <p class="mid"> This character, Bubbles, is a cheerful, feminine slime girl who serves as an intraductory character in her corresponding game. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="art">
            <h2 class="mid">-Dr. Kelvin Gismond-</h2>
            <p class="mid"> This is an example of my character designing process traditionally/on paper. Typically this is the beginning of my process, after numerous warm-up sketches. 
                Shown is a stereotypical mad scientist character reimagined with a more feminine or anime-like body type/clothing style.
            </p>
            <img class="right" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/kelvinGis.png" alt="A sketch page for a mad scientist character" width="37%" height="100%">
        </div>

        <div class="art">
            <img class="left" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/spiderMom.png" alt="Spider mother design" width="35%" height="100%">
            <h2 class="mid">-Character Design Ex. -</h2>
            <p class="mid"> This is an example of my character designing process digitally, featuring a spider monster character with a spiderling swarm mechanic. 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="art">
            <img class="left" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/IMG_4834.jpeg" alt="Helene Fullbody" width="24%" height="100%">
            <h2 class="mid">-Helene-</h2>
            <img class="right" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/IMG_5242.jpeg" alt="Helene Portrait" width="37%" height="100%">
            <p class="mid"> Helene is the protagonist of a long-term project I've been stewing on for the past four or so years, 
                and has gone through many iterations before coming to where she is now. I'll go over her and her lore more in depth in my projects page.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="art">
            <img class="left" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/IMG_5273.jpeg" alt="Vanraj - Traditional wear" width="34%" height="100%">
            <h2 class="mid">-Vanraj Khan-</h2>
            <img class="right" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/IMG_5293.jpeg" alt="Vanraj - Casual wear" width="30%" height="100%">
            <p class="mid"> Vanraj is my son. I hold him as a character very close to my heart, and I doubt I could fully explain his complexities in this paragraph. That aside, he 
                is most concisely described as a character study on teenaged bullies and the "mean jock" archetype.
            </p>

        <h2 class="mp">Illustration Examples</h2>
        <br>

        <div class="art">
            <img class="right" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/comicPanelEx.png" alt="Comic Panel Example" width="34%" height="100%">
            <h2 class="mid">-Comic Panel Ex. -</h2>
            <p class="mid"> This is an example of a more Webtoon-esque art style, with the addition of comic book lettering practice. The shown character is a nurse coming into work for a
                late night shift.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="art">
            <img class="left" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/wellfly.png" alt="Character Portrait" width="34%" height="100%">
            <h2 class="mid">-Character Portrait -</h2>
            <p class="mid"> This is a more painterly character illustration, featuring a fae changeling character, famed for his beauty, named Wellfly. In this piece I also used a much
                warmer color palette to suit his character and contrast his eyes.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="art">
            <img class="right" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/goldSkele.png" alt="Character Illustration" width="34%" height="100%">
            <h2 class="mid">-Character Illustration -</h2>
            <p class="mid"> In this piece I attempted to create a more evocative image with symbolism that can be left to the viewer's interpretation. I experimented with the lighting
                and adding or subtracting details to focus the concept.
            </p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="art">
            <img class="left" src="portfolio images/art for portfolio/mopCow.png" alt="Cartoon Style Example" width="34%" height="100%">
            <h2 class="mid">-Cartoon Character Ex. -</h2>
            <p class="mid"> In this character design, I used a more cartoony rendering and lineart style. I utilized cell shading and vibrant colors to create this effect, along with 
                exaggerated proportions and an unserious character concept; a cow maid character whose horns and hair come together to resemble a mop.
